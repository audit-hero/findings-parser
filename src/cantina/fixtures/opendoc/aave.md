### 1 Introduction 

#### 1.1 About Cantina 

 Cantina is a security services marketplace that connects top security researchers and solutions with clients. Learn more at cantina.xyz 

#### 1.2 Disclaimer 

A competition provides a broad evaluation of the security posture of the code at a particular moment based on the information available at the time of the review. While competitions endeavor to identify and disclose all potential security issues, they cannot guarantee that every vulnerability will be detected or that the code will be entirely secure against all possible attacks. The assessment is conducted based on the specific commit and version of the code provided. Any subsequent modifications to the code may introduce new vulnerabilities, therefore, any changes made to the code would require an additional security review. Please be advised that competitions are not a replacement for continuous security measures such as penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and regular code reviews. 

#### 1.3 Risk assessment 

 Severity Description Critical Must fix as soon as possible (if already deployed). 

 High Leads to a loss of a significant portion (>10%) of assets in the protocol, or significant harm to a majority of users. 

 Medium Loss of funds (global losses <10% or losses to only a subset of users, but still unacceptable) or core protocol requirements fail to function as intended by the specifications. 

 Low Losses will be annoying but bearable. Applies to things like griefing attacks that can be easily repaired or even gas inefficiencies. 

 Gas Optimization Suggestions around gas saving practices. 

 Informational Suggestions around best practices or readability. 

 1.3.1 Severity Classification 

The severity of security issues found during the security review is categorized based on the above table. Critical findings have a high likelihood of being exploited and must be addressed immediately. High findings are almost certain to occur, easy to perform, or not easy but highly incentivized thus must be fixed as soon as possible. Medium findings are conditionally possible or incentivized but are still relatively likely to occur and should be addressed. Low findings a rare combination of circumstances to exploit, or offer little to no incentive to exploit but are recommended to be addressed. Lastly, some findings might represent objective improvements that should be addressed but do not impact the projectâ€™s overall security (Gas and Informational findings). 


### 2 Security Review Summary 

Aave is a decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralized (perpetually) or undercollateralized (one-block liquidity) fashion. 

 From May 10th to May 20th Cantina hosted a competition based on Aave v3.1 Competition. The participants identified a total of 21 issues in the following risk categories: 

- Critical Risk: 0 

- High Risk: 0 

- Medium Risk: 1 

- Low Risk: 6 

- Gas Optimizations: 0 

- Informational: 14 


### 3 Findings 

#### 3.1 Medium Risk 

 3.1.1 _pendingltv[asset] will be set to 0 if 2 consecutive calls to setreservefreeze(asset, true) are executed 

 Submitted by r0bert, also found by StErMi, krikolkk, zigtur, lukaprini, Chad0 and 99Crits Severity: Medium Risk Context: PoolConfigurator.sol#L228 Description: The function setReserveFreeze() was modified in this 3.1 update to set LTV to 0 on freeze, or revert to previous value in case of unfreezing: function setReserveFreeze( address asset, bool freeze ) external override onlyRiskOrPoolOrEmergencyAdmins { DataTypes.ReserveConfigurationMap memory currentConfig = _pool.getConfiguration(asset); currentConfig.setFrozen(freeze); 

 if (freeze) { _pendingLtv[asset] = currentConfig.getLtv(); _isPendingLtvSet[asset] = true; currentConfig.setLtv(0); 

 emit PendingLtvChanged(asset, currentConfig.getLtv()); } else if (_isPendingLtvSet[asset]) { uint256 ltv = _pendingLtv[asset]; currentConfig.setLtv(ltv); 

 delete _pendingLtv[asset]; delete _isPendingLtvSet[asset]; 

 emit PendingLtvRemoved(asset); } 

With the current implementation, if 2 consecutive calls to setReserveFreeze(asset, true) are executed, the second one will reset the _pendingLtv[asset] to 0. This is enterely possible as the function contains the onlyRiskOrPoolOrEmergencyAdmins modifier: function _onlyRiskOrPoolOrEmergencyAdmins() internal view { IACLManager aclManager = IACLManager(_addressesProvider.getACLManager()); require( aclManager.isRiskAdmin(msg.sender) || aclManager.isPoolAdmin(msg.sender) || aclManager.isEmergencyAdmin(msg.sender), Errors.CALLER_NOT_RISK_OR_POOL_OR_EMERGENCY_ADMIN ); } 

 Let's imagine the following scenario: 

1. USDC asset experiences significant price fluctuations. 

2. The risk admin decides to freeze the asset by calling setReserveFreeze(USDC, true).     _pendingLtv[USDC] is set to 7700. 

3. The emergency admin has had the same thought and also calls setReserveFreeze(USDC, true). _-     pendingLtv[USDC] is set to currentConfig.getLtv() which, since the asset is already frozen, is 0. 

4. USDC price fluctuations has stopped and the risk admin decides to call setReserveFreeze(USDC,     false). USDC LTV is set to 0 as the _pendingLtv[USDC] mapping was previously overwritten. 

Temporary, as the LTV of USDC is 0, the users can still deposit the asset into the Aave protocol and earn interest on it, but they cannot use it as collateral for borrowing purposes. **Impact:** Medium as users can not use the unfrozen asset as collateral for borrowing purposes temporary, until this is noticed by an admin. 


 Likelihood: Medium, as there are multiple risk admins, pool admins & emergency admins that could call this function. Recommendation: It is recommended to update the setReserveFreeze() function as shown below: function setReserveFreeze( address asset, bool freeze ) external override onlyRiskOrPoolOrEmergencyAdmins { DataTypes.ReserveConfigurationMap memory currentConfig = _pool.getConfiguration(asset); currentConfig.setFrozen(freeze); 

 if (freeze && (currentConfig.getLtv() != 0)) { // <--------_pendingLtv[asset] = currentConfig.getLtv(); _isPendingLtvSet[asset] = true; currentConfig.setLtv(0); 

 emit PendingLtvChanged(asset, currentConfig.getLtv()); } else if (_isPendingLtvSet[asset]) { uint256 ltv = _pendingLtv[asset]; currentConfig.setLtv(ltv); 

 delete _pendingLtv[asset]; delete _isPendingLtvSet[asset]; 

 emit PendingLtvRemoved(asset); } 

#### 3.2 Low Risk 

 3.2.1 If the asset is frozen, collateralconfigurationchanged event will use the wrong ltv value 

 Submitted by StErMi Severity: Low Risk Context: PoolConfigurator.sol#L181 Description: If the asset is frozen (currentConfig.getFrozen() == true) the config's LTV parameter is not changed. The ltv value used in CollateralConfigurationChanged is the wrong one in this case, and the one from the config (unchanged) should be used. Recommendation: If currentConfig.getFrozen() == true, CollateralConfigurationChanged should use the LTV from the config and not the one passed as input. 

A better solution would be to update the CollateralConfigurationChanged event and pass both the LTV, the one that the admin would like to set but can't because the asset is frozen, and the one that instead will be used by the asset while the asset is in the frozen state. 

 3.2.2 setreservefreeze pass the wrong ltv value to the pendingltvchanged event 

 Submitted by StErMi Severity: Low Risk Context: PoolConfigurator.sol#L232 Description: When setReserveFreeze is executed and the admin freezes the asset (freeze == true) the current LTV is saved into _pendingLtv[asset] and the LTV of the config is set to 0. When PendingLtvChanged is emitted, the ltv parameter of the event is initialized with currentConfig.getLtv() that is no longer the \"old\" LTV but 0. Recommendation: Store currentConfig.getLtv() into a local variable before updating it to 0 and use such variable to initialize _pendingLtv[asset] and pass it to PendingLtvChanged 


 3.2.3 liquidationgraceperiod cannot be disabled anymore once configured 

 Submitted by StErMi Severity: Low Risk Context: PoolConfigurator.sol#L264 Description: Once the liquidationGracePeriod has been set for the asset, the admin won't be able to disable it completely. Let's assume that setReservePause(asset, false, 4 hours) has been called. This means that the asset cannot be liquidated or seized for 4 hours (included). For any security/market reason, the admin needs to reset it to 0 and allow immediately to be liquidated or be seized. 

The admin won't be able to disable it completely 

 1) Calling setReservePause(asset, false, 0) will do nothing, leaving the grace period unchanged. 2) Calling setReservePause(asset, false, 1) will set the grace period to block.timestamp + 1 seconds but liquidating or seizing the asset will be prevented up to block.timestamp + 1 included , this can't be counted as a complete shutdown of the grace period given that for at least 2 seconds liquidations/seizing cannot be done. Recommendation: Aave should consider adding a disableLiquidationGracePeriod that will set the liquidation grace period in the past: /// @inheritdoc IPoolConfigurator function disableLiquidationGracePeriod( address asset, ) public override onlyEmergencyOrPoolAdmin { // TODO: add requirement that pool is not disabled // TODO: add requirement that grace period is indeed enabled 

 // set the liquidation grace period in the pass to fully disable it uint40 until = uint40(block.timestamp) 1; _pool.setLiquidationGracePeriod(asset, until); // TODO: consider emitting a specific event for the grace period disable event. having a timestamp in the ,â†’ past // could be considered confusing emit LiquidationGracePeriodChanged(asset, until); } 

 3.2.4 Insufficient check in validateflashloan still allows to borrow/flashloan more assets than the atoken's totalsupply 

_Submitted by krikolkk, also found by nmirchev8, Bauchibred and r0bert_ **Severity:** Low Risk **Context:** ValidationLogic.sol#L473-L474 **Description:** The function validateFlashloan in ValidationLogic is used to validate the parameters of flashloans executed by a user. One of the new checks introduced in AAVE 3.1. adds an extra soft protection on borrowing actions, expecting the transaction to revert if the amount borrowed exceeds the total supply of the respective aToken. Although this check will always hold when executing flashLoanSimple or borrow, it will not have in the case of flashLoan. Since executeFlashLoan calls validateFlashloan, which calls validateFlashloanSimple, where the amount is being checked against the total supply, in a loop, a user can circumvent this check by executing a flashloan where assets[i] = assets[i+1], with amounts[i] <= totalSupply() and amounts[i+1] <= totalSupply(), but amounts[i] + amounts[i+1] > totalSupply. Since flashLoan can also be used to borrow, which is done in a loop, it is also possible to borrow more than the total supply, circumventing the introduced check. Note that the virtualUnderlyingBalance of the asset must be greater than or equal to amounts[i] + amounts[i+1], and the total supply of the respective aToken must be greater than or equal to amounts[i] + amounts[i+1] as well. 

 Proof of concept: For this test, we will first do a little tweak in the MockFlashLoanReceiver contract to handle allowances better: 


 function executeOperation( address[] memory assets, uint256[] memory amounts, uint256[] memory premiums, address, // initiator bytes memory // params ) public override returns (bool) { if (_failExecution) { emit ExecutedWithFail(assets, amounts, premiums); return !_simulateEOA; } 

 for (uint256 i = 0; i < assets.length; i++) { //mint to this contract the specific amount MintableERC20 token = MintableERC20(assets[i]); 

 //check the contract has the specified balance require( amounts[i] <= IERC20(assets[i]).balanceOf(address(this)), 'Invalid balance for the contract' ); 

 uint256 amountToReturn = (_amountToApprove != 0) ? _amountToApprove : amounts[i] + premiums[i]; //execution does not fail mint tokens and return them to the _destination 

 token.mint(premiums[i]); 

 + uint allowance = IERC20(assets[i]).allowance(address(this), address(POOL)); + + IERC20(assets[i]).approve(address(POOL), allowance + amountToReturn); 

- IERC20(assets[i]).approve(address(POOL), amountToReturn);     } 

After that, we can add this test to the Pool.FlashLoans.t.sol test file: 

 function test_flashloan_borrow_moreThanTotalSupply() public { vm.prank(carol); contracts.poolProxy.withdraw(tokenList.wbtc, 20e8, carol); 

 vm.prank(alice); contracts.poolProxy.supply(tokenList.wbtc, 0.5e8, alice, 0); 

 // first we will make sure the virtual underlying balance and underlying balance are greater than the total ,â†’ supply // so bob will first flashloan 0.5 wbtc, while 0.05 wbtc will go to accruedToTreasury 

 vm.startPrank(poolAdmin); contracts.poolConfiguratorProxy.updateFlashloanPremiumTotal(10_00); contracts.poolConfiguratorProxy.updateFlashloanPremiumToProtocol(100_00); TestnetERC20(tokenList.wbtc).transferOwnership(address(mockFlashSimpleReceiver)); vm.stopPrank(); 

 bytes memory emptyParams; 

 vm.prank(bob); contracts.poolProxy.flashLoanSimple( address(mockFlashSimpleReceiver), tokenList.wbtc, 0.5e8, emptyParams, 0 ); 

 // now we will do the flashloan that is supposed to revert address[] memory assets = new address[](2); uint256[] memory amounts = new uint256[](2); uint256[] memory modes = new uint256[](2); assets[0] = tokenList.wbtc; assets[1] = tokenList.wbtc; amounts[0] = 0.5e8; amounts[1] = 0.05e8; 


 address aTokenAddress = contracts.poolProxy.getReserveData(tokenList.wbtc).aTokenAddress; // make sure we are indeed flashloaing more than the total supply assertGt(amounts[0] + amounts[1], IERC20(aTokenAddress).totalSupply()); 

 // just to showcase the vulnerability we will set the fees to 0 vm.startPrank(poolAdmin); contracts.poolConfiguratorProxy.updateFlashloanPremiumTotal(0); contracts.poolConfiguratorProxy.updateFlashloanPremiumToProtocol(0); vm.stopPrank(); 

 vm.prank(address(mockFlashSimpleReceiver)); TestnetERC20(tokenList.wbtc).transferOwnership(address(mockFlashReceiver)); 

 vm.prank(alice); contracts.poolProxy.flashLoan( address(mockFlashReceiver), assets, amounts, modes, alice, emptyParams, 0 ); } 

The test showcases that it is still possible to perform the action that the v3.1 upgrade should have fixed. Note that with this function it is also possible to borrow the funds flashloaned. **Recommendation:** Consider not allowing non-unique assets to be flashloaned, or, in the case of nonunique assets in the flashloan assets parameter, compare the sum of such assets against the total supply instead of each amount separately. 

 3.2.5 Setting emode category params can potentially set emode ltv to a lower value than the pending ltv of a frozen asset 

_Submitted by krikolkk, also found by zigtur_ **Severity:** Low Risk **Context:** PoolConfigurator.sol#L379 **Description:** The function setEModeCateogry in PoolConfigurator updates the EMode params for a specific EMode category. One requirement for these new parameters is that the EMode ltv value is greater than the current ltv of all the assets within the category. However, the category can contain frozen assets, and, in this case, either purposely or mistakenly set the EMode ltv to a value lower than the current ltv (which is cached) of the frozen asset within the category. 

 Proof of concept: 


 function setEModeCategory( uint8 categoryId, uint16 ltv, uint16 liquidationThreshold, uint16 liquidationBonus, address oracle, string calldata label ) external override onlyRiskOrPoolAdmins { // ... 

 address[] memory reserves = _pool.getReservesList(); for (uint256 i = 0; i < reserves.length; i++) { DataTypes.ReserveConfigurationMap memory currentConfig = _pool.getConfiguration(reserves[i]); if (categoryId == currentConfig.getEModeCategory()) { require(ltv > currentConfig.getLtv(), Errors.INVALID_EMODE_CATEGORY_PARAMS); // <current ltv will be 0 ,â†’ on frozen asset, after unfreeze it can be higher than EMode ltv require( liquidationThreshold > currentConfig.getLiquidationThreshold(), Errors.INVALID_EMODE_CATEGORY_PARAMS ); } } 

 // ... } 

**Recommendation:** Consider adding a check for frozen assets: 

 } else if (\\_isPendingLtvSet[asset]) { uint256 ltv = \\_pendingLtv[asset]; 

 function setEModeCategory( uint8 categoryId, uint16 ltv, uint16 liquidationThreshold, uint16 liquidationBonus, address oracle, string calldata label ) external override onlyRiskOrPoolAdmins { require(ltv != 0, Errors.INVALID_EMODE_CATEGORY_PARAMS); require(liquidationThreshold != 0, Errors.INVALID_EMODE_CATEGORY_PARAMS); 

 // validation of the parameters: the LTV can // only be lower or equal than the liquidation threshold // (otherwise a loan against the asset would cause instantaneous liquidation) require(ltv <= liquidationThreshold, Errors.INVALID_EMODE_CATEGORY_PARAMS); require( liquidationBonus > PercentageMath.PERCENTAGE_FACTOR, Errors.INVALID_EMODE_CATEGORY_PARAMS ); 

 // if threshold * bonus is less than PERCENTAGE_FACTOR, it's guaranteed that at the moment // a loan is taken there is enough collateral available to cover the liquidation bonus require( uint256(liquidationThreshold).percentMul(liquidationBonus) <= PercentageMath.PERCENTAGE_FACTOR, Errors.INVALID_EMODE_CATEGORY_PARAMS ); 

 address[] memory reserves = _pool.getReservesList(); for (uint256 i = 0; i < reserves.length; i++) { DataTypes.ReserveConfigurationMap memory currentConfig = _pool.getConfiguration(reserves[i]); if (categoryId == currentConfig.getEModeCategory()) { + uint256 currentLtv = _isPendingLtvSet[reserves[i]]? _pendingLtv[reserves[i]] : currentConfig.getLtv(); 

- require(ltv > currentConfig.getLtv(), Errors.INVALID_EMODE_CATEGORY_PARAMS); + require(ltv > currentLtv, Errors.INVALID_EMODE_CATEGORY_PARAMS);     require(        liquidationThreshold > currentConfig.getLiquidationThreshold(),        Errors.INVALID_EMODE_CATEGORY_PARAMS     ); } } 

 _pool.configureEModeCategory( categoryId, 


 DataTypes.EModeCategory({ ltv: ltv, liquidationThreshold: liquidationThreshold, liquidationBonus: liquidationBonus, priceSource: oracle, label: label }) ); emit EModeCategoryAdded(categoryId, ltv, liquidationThreshold, liquidationBonus, oracle, label); } 

 3.2.6 State changing function doesn't emit events in executesetliquidationgraceperiod() 

 Submitted by ladboy233 Severity: Low Risk Context: PoolLogic.sol#L132-L138 Description: State changing function executeSetLiquidationGracePeriod() is used to set the liquidationGracePeriodUntil to the new timestamp. As the function changes the state, it should emit events for parameters change: 

 function executeSetLiquidationGracePeriod( mapping(address => DataTypes.ReserveData) storage reservesData, address asset, uint40 until ) external { reservesData[asset].liquidationGracePeriodUntil = until; } 

 Impact: Not adding an event will obfuscate off-chain monitoring when changing system parameters. Recommendation: Ensure these endpoints emit events as some off-chain agents might be monitoring the protocol for these events. 

#### 3.3 Informational 

 3.3.1 swaptovariable natspec is incorrect 

 Submitted by StErMi Severity: Informational Context: IPool.sol#L384 Description: The swapToVariable function is described as \"Permission-less movement of stable positions to variable\". From the official docs: allowing any address to swap any stable rate user to variable, without changing anything else in the position. 

The natspec documentation instead says that the function allows the owner of the debt position to swap **his own** debt from stable to variable. **Recommendation:** Update the natspec to document the real behavior and scope of the function. 


 3.3.2 executeswapborrowratemode miss the natspec documentation of the new user parameter 

 Submitted by StErMi Severity: Informational Context: BorrowLogic.sol#L317 Description: executeSwapBorrowRateMode miss the natspec documentation of the new user parameter Recommendation: Add the natspec docs for the new user parameter 

 3.3.3 setreservefreeze should trigger the collateralconfigurationchanged event if ltv is changed in the config 

 Submitted by StErMi Severity: Informational Context: (No context files were provided by the reviewer) Description: When setReserveFreeze is executed, based on freeze and _isPendingLtvSet[asset] the ltv value of the config could be changed. 

When ltv is changed, usually the PoolConfigurator triggers the CollateralConfigurationChanged event. 

This is not done inside the setReserveFreeze function 

 Recommendation: If setReserveFreeze changes the pool's LTV it should trigger the CollateralConfigurationChanged event to reflect the change and be coherent with configureReserveAsCollateral 

 3.3.4 virtual_acc_active name is not coherent with the other masks defined in reserveconfiguration 

 Submitted by StErMi Severity: Informational Context: ReserveConfiguration.sol#L32 Description: VIRTUAL_ACC_ACTIVE should be renamed as VIRTUAL_ACC_ACTIVE_MASK to be coherent with the other masks. Recommendation: Rename VIRTUAL_ACC_ACTIVE to VIRTUAL_ACC_ACTIVE_MASK. 

 3.3.5 poolrevisionfourinitialize.initialize is not initializing the new \"pending ltv\" logic for already frozen assets 

_Submitted by StErMi_ **Severity:** Informational **Context:** _(No context files were provided by the reviewer)_ **Description:** When the upgrade script is executed, the PoolRevisionFourInitialize.initialize logic is applied. Inside such logic, the new data structure and logic used for frozen address is not applied and _pendingLtv and _isPendingLtvSet will remain not-initialized for already frozen assets. 

This is not a security concern because after the upgrade, unfreezing assets will not do any harm given that the else if (_isPendingLtvSet[asset]) branch will be skipped because _isPendingLtvSet is not initialized. It's still a good practice to apply the intended behavior during the upgrade for the unfrozen assets to be in a state that is consistent with the new logic. **Recommendation:** During the upgrade phase, Aave should loop all the assets and initialize the frozen logic to all the already-frozen assets. If the asset is frozen, the following changes should be applied: _pendingLtv[asset] = currentConfig.getLtv(); _isPendingLtvSet[asset] = true; currentConfiguration.setLtv(0); 


 3.3.6 Past or current grace period can be setup : conflicting the natspec of new reservedata struct 

 Submitted by 0xumarkhatab Severity: Informational Context: (No context files were provided by the reviewer) Description: The Pool.sol setLiquidationGracePeriod: /// @inheritdoc IPool function setLiquidationGracePeriod( address asset, uint40 until ) external virtual override onlyPoolConfigurator { require(_reserves[asset].id != 0 || _reservesList[0] == asset, Errors.ASSET_NOT_LISTED); PoolLogic.executeSetLiquidationGracePeriod(_reserves, asset, until); } 

 allows setting the graceperiod pram to either in future, present or past due to no validation on it. And its natspec states this also: 

 /// @inheritdoc IPool /** * @dev To enable a liquidation grace period, a timestamp in the future should be set, * To disable a liquidation grace period, any timestamp in the past works, like 0 

 However if we look at the Natspec of newly updated ReserveData struct: 

 struct ReserveData { //snip 

 //timestamp in the future, until when liquidations are not allowed on the reserve uint40 liquidationGracePeriodUntil; 

 //snip 

 } 

The Natspec of the argument states that the timestamp needs to be in the future always. Disregarding any external validation beyond Pool's method for setting grace period, this is an issue where bounds need to be ensured if they are ensured outside of the Pool.sol, the Natspec should be updated to reflect that only future grace periods are accepted. **Recommendation:** Correct Natspec or implement bounds on until param to only be in future, i.e. until > block.timestamp. 

 3.3.7 Decimals mismatching during reserve initialization will break calculations 

 Submitted by zigtur Severity: Informational Context: ConfiguratorLogic.sol#L108, ConfiguratorLogic.sol#L63, ConfiguratorLogic.sol#L77, ConfiguratorLogic.sol#L91, PoolConfigurator.sol#L84-L87 Description: The v3.1 update adds a minimum decimals for listed assets. During a reserve initialization, a newly implemented check ensure that the asset's decimals is greater than or equal to 6. However, the reserve is initialized with an underlyingAssetDecimals parameter that is not checked. This parameter is user controlled, so it can be different than the real asset's decimals. Proof of concept: The PoolConfigurator.initReserves function ensures that the asset's decimals is greater than 5: 


 function initReserves( ConfiguratorInputTypes.InitReserveInput[] calldata input ) external override onlyAssetListingOrPoolAdmins { IPool cachedPool = _pool; for (uint256 i = 0; i < input.length; i++) { require(IERC20Detailed(input[i].underlyingAsset).decimals() > 5, Errors.INVALID_DECIMALS); // @POC: ensure ,â†’ that decimals is greater than 5 

 ConfiguratorLogic.executeInitReserve(cachedPool, input[i]); // @POC: Use input parameters to initialize ,â†’ the reserve emit ReserveInterestRateDataChanged( input[i].underlyingAsset, input[i].interestRateStrategyAddress, input[i].interestRateData ); } } 

 However, the ConfiguratorLogic.executeInitReserve will initialize the reserve with a user-controlled parameter named underlyingAssetDecimals instead of the asset's decimals: function executeInitReserve( IPool pool, ConfiguratorInputTypes.InitReserveInput calldata input ) external { address aTokenProxyAddress = _initTokenWithProxy( input.aTokenImpl, abi.encodeWithSelector( IInitializableAToken.initialize.selector, pool, input.treasury, input.underlyingAsset, input.incentivesController, input.underlyingAssetDecimals, // @POC: user-controlled parameter can mismatch asset.decimals input.aTokenName, input.aTokenSymbol, input.params ) ); 

As this user-controlled value is not checked against asset.decimals, there can be a mismatch in decimals. This will lead to over or under estimations in future calculations due to this decimals inconsistency. 

 Recommendation: Consider adding a check to ensure that the user input underlyingAssetDecimals matches the expected asset.decimals. The following patch implements this check: 

 diff --git a/src/core/contracts/protocol/pool/PoolConfigurator.sol ,â†’ b/src/core/contracts/protocol/pool/PoolConfigurator.sol index e023dc6..9e870d5 100644 --a/src/core/contracts/protocol/pool/PoolConfigurator.sol +++ b/src/core/contracts/protocol/pool/PoolConfigurator.sol @@ -82,7 +82,8 @@ abstract contract PoolConfigurator is VersionedInitializable, IPoolConfigurator ) external override onlyAssetListingOrPoolAdmins { IPool cachedPool = _pool; for (uint256 i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {

 ConfiguratorLogic.executeInitReserve(cachedPool, input[i]); emit ReserveInterestRateDataChanged( 
  
 Note: The patch can be applied through git apply. 


 3.3.8 Consider documenting explicitly that virtual accounting is a requirement for \"normal\" reserves 

 Submitted by JCN Severity: Informational Context: DefaultInterestRateStrategyV2.sol#L122-L124 Description: The documentation regarding Aave's new features currently state that the implementation of the virtual accounting feature includes an optional virtualUnderlyingBalance field for assets listed on Aave and that \"Special\" assets like GHO (minted instead of supplied) are to be configured without virtual accounting. However, it is not explicitly mentioned (in the documentation and natspec) that enabling virtual accounting is actually a requirement for \"normal\" reserves, i.e. reserves which support supplying. 

As shown in the context above, any reserve configured with virtual accounting disabled will _not_ have a liquidity rate and the borrow rate will be capped at the baseVariableBorrowRate. For \"normal\" reserves, this would translate to a loss of interest for suppliers and the treasury (if a reserve factor is set) and break the economic incentives of the interest rate model. **Recommendation:** Aave should consider explicitly documenting (in documentation and natspec) that virtual accounting is a **requirement** for \" _normal_ \" reserves, and outline the implications of \"normal\" reserves opting out of using the virtual accounting feature. 

 3.3.9 Unnecessary storage read during pool::borrow calls 

_Submitted by JCN_ **Severity:** Informational **Context:** Pool.sol#L233 **Description:** When a borrow occurs, the _maxStableRateBorrowSizePercent storage variable is read and used to populate the maxStableRateBorrowSizePercent field of the ExecuteBorrowParams memory struct used during the executeBorrow call. This value is then passed into the maxStableLoanPercent field of the ValidateBorrowParams memory struct used during validation. The value is then ultimately used on L299 of ValidationLogic::validateBorrow when a user is attempting to borrow in stable rate mode. However, since Aave is deprecating stable rate mode, all reserves have disabled stable rate borrowing and thus any attempts to borrow in stable rate mode will revert on line 286. As a result, line 299 is now unreachable code and therefore the value of the _maxStableRateBorrowSizePercent storage variable will never be utilized during borrow calls. **Recommendation:** Consider setting the maxStableRateBorrowSizePercent field to 0 instead of performing an unnecessary storage read. 

 3.3.10 Consider optimizing poolconfigurator::_checknosuppliers internal function 

 Submitted by JCN Severity: Informational Context: PoolConfigurator.sol#L575 Description: When the _checkNoSuppliers internal function is invoked it performs a call to the Pool::getReserveData function to grab the reserve state data from the Pool's storage. However, this function will perform unnecessary memory operations in this context since it will now copy the reserve state to a new ReserveDataLegacy memory struct. In this internal function call the only reserve state utilized is the accruedToTreasury storage value, which is present in both the ReserveData and ReserveDataLegacy struct. Therefore, the Pool::getReserveDataExtended function can instead be invoked in order to avoid unnecessary memory operations and directly retrieve a single copy of the reserve data via the ReserveData struct. Recommendation: Consider invoking the Pool::getReserveDataExtended function instead of Pool::getReserveData to improve gas efficiency. 


 3.3.11 The function swaptovariable() is missing in l2pool 

_Submitted by ladboy233_ **Severity:** Informational **Context:** L2Pool.sol#L83-L89 **Description:** The function swapToVariable() allows a borrower to swap his debt between stable and variable mode. 

According to the Aave docs: 

 Implementation-wise, this adds a swapToVariable() function in the Aave pool, allowing any address to swap any stable rate user to variable, without changing anything else in the position. 

While the contract Pool implements the function swapToVariable() but the L2Pool contract doesn't implement the function swapToVariable() to allow any address to swap any stable rate user to variable, without changing anything else in the position. **Impact:** @notice Calldata optimized extension of the Pool contract allowing users to pass compact calldata representation 

- to reduce transaction costs on rollups. But a user cannot reduce the transaction costs on rollups by calling swapToVariableRate. **Recommendation:** Add the swapToVariable() function L2Pool. 

 3.3.12 Consider optimizing the poolconfigurator::setreserveinterestrate... functions 

 Submitted by JCN Severity: Informational Context: PoolConfigurator.sol#L469, PoolConfigurator.sol#L479 Description: Both functions mentioned above invoke the Pool::getReserveData function in order to retrieve a copy of the reserve state data from the Pool's storage. However, the getReserveData function will now perform extra memory operations in order to copy the reserve state into a new ReserveDataLegacy struct. This is unnecessary in the context of the two functions shown above since the only reserve value utilized in these function calls is the reserveInterestRateStrategyAddress, which is present in both the ReserveData and ReserveDataLegacy structs. 

Therefore, the Pool::getReserveDataExtended function can instead be invoked in order to directly retrieve a single copy of the reserve data from the Pool's storage via a ReserveData struct. **Recommendation:** Consider using the Pool::getReserveDataExtended function instead of Poo::getReserveData to improve gas efficiency. 

 3.3.13 executedropreserve() doesn't clean interest rates from defaultreserveinterestratestrategyv2 upon dropping a reserve 

 Submitted by alix40 Severity: Informational Context: PoolLogic.sol#L146-L155 Description: After the introduction of the statefull DefaultReserveInterestRateStrategyV2 the interest rate parameters for each reserve is saved in the local mapping _interestRateData. When a new Reserve is added to the Pool, those params are set in the _interestRateData mapping but when a Reserve is dropped or removed from the Protocol those params will stay in the mapping and are never cleaned: 


 function executeDropReserve( mapping(address => DataTypes.ReserveData) storage reservesData, mapping(uint256 => address) storage reservesList, address asset ) external { DataTypes.ReserveData storage reserve = reservesData[asset]; ValidationLogic.validateDropReserve(reservesList, reserve, asset); reservesList[reservesData[asset].id] = address(0); delete reservesData[asset]; } 

This is inconsistent and wouldn't clean the mapping upon the removal of a token. 

 Recommendation: We recommend cleaning up the rates params for the dropped param from the DefaultReserveInterestRateStrategyV2. does not include the user parameter which is beneficial for code quality and review. function executeSwapBorrowRateMode( DataTypes.ReserveData storage reserve, DataTypes.UserConfigurationMap storage userConfig, address asset, address user, // @audit add Natspec for user DataTypes.InterestRateMode interestRateMode ) external { DataTypes.ReserveCache memory reserveCache = reserve.cache(); 

 reserve.updateState(reserveCache); 

 // ... } 

 Recommendation: Add Natspec for user: + * @param user The user of the asset being repaid 

 3.3.14 Undocumented function parameters 

 Submitted by 99Crits , also found by Mansa11 Severity: Informational Context: BorrowLogic.sol#L308 Description: There are multiple functions in the codebase where parameters got added, but their meaning was not documented in the function docs: 

- BorrowLogic.executeSwapBorrowRateMode added address user. 

- ValidationLogic.validateSupply added DataTypes.ReserveData storage reserve and address     onBehalfOf. 

- ValidationLogic.validateFlashloanSimple added uint256 amount.
